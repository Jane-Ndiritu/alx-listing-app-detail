This project follows a modular folder structure to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is an overview of the key directories and their purposes:
### 1. Components
Houses all reusable React components that make up the UI.
Each component (e.g., Card, Button, Navbar) usually lives in its own folder for better organization and scalability.
### 2. Interfaces
Contains all TypeScript interfaces and types used across the project.
Centralizing types ensures consistent data models and type safety.
### 3. Constants
Defines reusable configuration values and constants, preventing duplication and hardcoding.
### 4. Public/Assets
Stores static files that are served directly to the browser.
Useful for images, icons, and other resources that donâ€™t change at runtime.
